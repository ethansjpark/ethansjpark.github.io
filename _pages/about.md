ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Ethan Here!

I'm a Bachelor's student at Emory studying Computer Science & Mathematics.

I'm currently building a Financial Data Platform [Tries](https://github.com/polymic) at [Polymic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/polymic-tries/about/?viewAsMember=true) and researching Computer Vision through [pathfinder](https://github.com/ethansjpark/pathfinder-vision-robustness).

I've been a Research Assistant at the [Cognition & Visualization Lab](https://cav-lab.github.io/), working on data visualization, machine learning, and neurodivergence.

I love combining Computer Vision, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Agentic Systems to tackle real-world problems across industries like robotics, fintech, and autonomous driving.

I'm also passionate about engaging with and investing in early-stage startups in AI, fintech, robotics, and healthcare.

Worked previously at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) as a software development engineer intern.

Always open to conversationsâ€”feel free to reach out!
