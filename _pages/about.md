ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Ethan Here!

I love combining software development, AI, and psychology to tackle real-world problems across different industries. My passion lies in creating impactful projects that showcase how technology can enhance everyday life, especially for marginalized individuals from our society.

I am currently a junior at Emory University pursuing B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics and a Research Assistant at the [Cognition & Visualization Lab](https://cav-lab.github.io/).

Also, I was previously a software development engineer intern at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

I have a strong interest in fintech, autonomous driving, and deep learning. I'm also passionate about investing in transformative technologies at the earliest stages. Lately, I've been exploring opportunities in pre-seed startups, particularly in AI, healthcare, Medicare, and biotech.

Previously, I built [MEDi](https://github.com/2nd-Company/MEDi), an AI-powered app assisting visually impaired individuals in identifying pharmaceutical products and Third Eye, a motion-detection system for visually impaired soccer players.

If youâ€™d like to collaborate on a project or interested in teaming up, feel free to reach out!
