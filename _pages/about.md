ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Ethan Here!

I love combining software development, AI, and psychology to tackle real-world problems across different industries. My passion lies in creating impactful projects that showcase how technology can enhance everyday life, especially for marginalized individuals from our society.

I am currently a sophomore at Emory University pursuing B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics and a Research Assistant at the [Cognition & Visualization Lab](https://cav-lab.github.io/).

Also, I am an incoming software development engineer intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) over the summer of 2025!

My background further includes machine learning, NLP, and AI model deployment, with a strong interest in fintech, autonomous driving, and deep learning.

Beyond my technical work, I co-founded [MEDi](https://github.com/2nd-Company/MEDi), an AI-powered app assisting visually impaired individuals in identifying pharmaceutical products. I also founded Third Eye, a motion-detection system for visually impaired soccer players.

Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on innovative projects, whether it's building efficient AI models, automating financial analysis, or exploring cutting-edge deep learning applications.

If youâ€™d like to collaborate on a project or interested in teaming up, feel free to reach out!
