ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Ethan Here!

I'm a Bachelor's student at Emory studying Computer Science & Mathematics.

I'm currently building a Financial Data Platform [Tries](https://github.com/polymic) at [Polymic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/polymic-tries/about/?viewAsMember=true).

I've been a Research Assistant at the [Cognition & Visualization Lab](https://cav-lab.github.io/), working on fata visualization, machine learning, neurodivergence, and etc.

I love combining software, deep learning, and AI to tackle real-world problems across industries like fintech, robotics, and autonomous driving. My passion lies in creating impactful projects that showcase accessibility and automation.

I'm also passionate about engaging with and investing in early-stage startups in AI, fintech, robotics, and healthcare.

Worked previously at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) as a software development engineer intern.

Always open to conversationsâ€”feel free to reach out!
