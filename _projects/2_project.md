Third Eye is a motion-detection app designed to help visually impaired soccer players identify opponents and track the ball in real-time. The AI model achieves 85% detection accuracy and provides crucial audio feedback to enhance player awareness on the field.

As a former soccer player, I experienced firsthand the importance of spatial awareness in sports. After an injury ended my playing career, I wanted to create a tool that empowers visually impaired athletes, ensuring they can play safely and confidently. Third Eye was developed in collaboration with the Siloam Center for the Blind in Seoul, where it was donated and recognized with an award from the Korea Federation of Volunteer Centers.
